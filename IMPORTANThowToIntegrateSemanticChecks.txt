#### How to integrate semantic Checks to Checkstyle ###
0. Download wordnet 3.0 and move it to C:\WordNet\3.0, under linux or other system you need to change the code and put the right path for wordnet
refactoring will be made to make it easier
1. go into latest version of Checkstyle's code into the folder  checks/naming copy paste the semantic folder 
2. in Checkstyle's root where the pom.xml is copy paste uncleBobChecks.xml
3. download from here : https://www.dropbox.com/s/xpvixrlo1nvbsb5/semantic%20analysis%20Lib.rar?dl=0 the jar files needed,
put them into Checkstyle 
3. Now you must compile Checkstyle
* mvn clean compile
then use 
* mvn clean package -Passembly
it will create many files in the target folder 
4. Use the next command to run the right jar file with the right attributes
java -jar target/checkstyle-X.X-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -c uncleBobChecks.xml folderOrFileToCheck

some of the above information is taken from http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/cmdline.html
